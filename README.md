# RayTracer
The goal of this project is to learn the basics of raytracing and the math behind it, without worrying about graphics libraries.
# Output
The output is written to a .ppm (portable pixel map) file, which can be opened using almost any fileviewer (Preview on Mac) or using [PPM viewer for vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ngtystr.ppm-pgm-viewer-for-vscode)
